Matlab and Python (sklearn) both have a large domain of algorithms. Unfortunately Matlab doesn't contain
all the algorithms required or may require additional (pricey) toolboxes. And then there is
the case of reproducibility of results. Not all researchers use both languages fluently or it
may be hard to diversify their current matlab code to use algorithms present in sklearn

So, this is a try to use sklearn within matlab and in the first version use supervised algorithms
in sklearn from within matlab. Hopefully, if it works for you, and if you have any updates,
let me know and i can integrate them in. My hope is that one day most features of sklearn/numpy/scipy
could be used within matlab, including pipelines, unsupervised learning, CV, clustering among others
